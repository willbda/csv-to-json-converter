# Understanding package-lock.json

## What is package-lock.json?

`package-lock.json` is automatically generated by npm and serves as a **dependency lockfile**. Think of it as a detailed receipt for exactly which versions of packages were installed.

## Why does it exist?

### Your package.json says:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "papaparse": "^5.5.3"
  }
}
```

The `^` means "install 5.5.3 or any compatible newer version" (like 5.5.4, 5.6.0, but not 6.0.0).

### The problem:
- Today you install and get papaparse 5.5.3
- Next month someone else installs and gets papaparse 5.6.2 
- Your code might behave differently!

### The solution:
`package-lock.json` records the EXACT versions that were installed:
```json
{
  "papaparse": {
    "version": "5.5.3",
    "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/papaparse/-/papaparse-5.5.3.tgz",
    "integrity": "sha512-..."
  }
}
```

## Should you commit it?

**Yes!** Always commit package-lock.json to version control. It ensures everyone gets identical dependencies.

## Key points:
- Generated automatically when you run `npm install`
- Ensures reproducible builds
- Don't edit it manually
- If it conflicts during git merges, delete it and run `npm install` again
