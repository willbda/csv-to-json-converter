# ðŸš€ Your Software Engineering Growth Path

## Phase 1: Module Mastery (This Week)
**Goal:** Internalize separation of concerns

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Study the Utils module** - Understand why each function is static
- [ ] **Trace data flow** - Follow how CSV data moves through the modules
- [ ] **Complete the architecture challenge** - Design the date detection feature
- [ ] **Ask yourself:** "If I had to explain this architecture to another developer in 5 minutes, what would I say?"

### Success Metric:
You can add a new utility function to the right module without hesitation.

## Phase 2: Error Handling Mastery (Next Week)  
**Goal:** Build robust systems that handle failure gracefully

### Current Weakness:
Your original code had basic try/catch blocks, but no systematic error recovery.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Audit error scenarios** - What can go wrong in CSV processing?
- [ ] **Design error boundaries** - Which module handles which type of error?
- [ ] **Implement user-friendly errors** - No more "undefined is not a function" 
- [ ] **Add logging** - Help users (and you) debug issues

### Questions to Answer:
- What happens when a CSV has malformed data?
- How do you handle network failures when saving files?
- What if the user's vault runs out of space?

---

## Phase 3: Performance & Scale (Week 3-4)
**Goal:** Handle large datasets without crashing Obsidian

### Current Limitation:
Your code loads entire CSVs into memory. What about 100MB files?

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Streaming CSV processing** - Process data in chunks
- [ ] **Progress indicators** - Show users what's happening
- [ ] **Memory management** - Don't hold references to large objects
- [ ] **Background processing** - Don't block the UI thread

### Advanced Challenge:
Process a 50,000-row CSV without the user noticing any lag.

## Phase 4: Testing & Quality (Week 5-6)
**Goal:** Write code you can deploy with confidence

### Current State:
You have one basic test file. Professional code needs comprehensive testing.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Unit tests** - Test each module in isolation
- [ ] **Integration tests** - Test modules working together  
- [ ] **Edge case testing** - Malformed CSVs, empty files, huge files
- [ ] **User acceptance testing** - Does it solve real problems?

### Quality Gates:
- 80%+ code coverage
- All tests pass before any commit
- No console errors in normal usage

---

## Phase 5: User Experience Excellence (Week 7-8)
**Goal:** Create software people love to use

### Current UX Issues:
- No keyboard shortcuts
- Limited undo/redo
- No drag-and-drop file import
- No recent files list

### Tasks:
- [ ] **User research** - What do people actually need?
- [ ] **Accessibility** - Screen reader support, keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Performance perception** - Make slow operations feel fast
- [ ] **Error recovery** - Users should never lose work

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Architecture (Month 2)
**Goal:** Design systems that grow with requirements

### Advanced Patterns:
- [ ] **Plugin system** - Let users extend functionality
- [ ] **Configuration management** - Complex user preferences
- [ ] **State management** - Handle complex UI state changes
- [ ] **Caching strategies** - Remember expensive operations

### Master-Level Challenge:
Design a system where adding a new output format requires changing only 2-3 lines of code.

## Your Monthly Checkpoints

### Month 1: "I understand modular architecture"
- You can break down any complex feature into focused modules
- You instinctively ask "which module should handle this?"
- You write code that's easy to test

### Month 3: "I think about edge cases"
- Your code handles errors gracefully
- You consider performance implications
- You write documentation that helps future-you

### Month 6: "I design for change"
- Your architecture adapts to new requirements
- You balance flexibility with simplicity
- You make technical decisions that age well

---

## The Bigger Picture

**You're not just learning to code - you're learning to think systematically about complex problems.**

### What Separates Senior Developers:

1. **They see patterns** - "This is like the logging problem I solved last year"
2. **They anticipate change** - "What happens when requirements change?"
3. **They consider trade-offs** - "Fast vs. maintainable vs. simple"
4. **They communicate clearly** - Code is for humans, not just computers

## Your Next Action

**Pick ONE task from Phase 1 and spend 2 hours on it this week.**

Don't try to do everything. Deep focus on one concept is better than surface knowledge of many.

*Ready to level up? The gap between "can code" and "can architect" is smaller than you think - but it requires intentional practice.*
